SBitter
=======

SBitter is SBHX's Twitter clone.  We're writing many such clones using
various languages and frameworks for comparison.


Terminology
-----------

* A "SBitter" is a user of this unique and impressive service

* Each message is "SBit"

* The act of sending a message is known as "SBitting"

* If you sent a SBit, you "SBot" (past tense)


Competition
-----------

If this becomes a language/framework/technology competition, here are
some ideas for how each app should be scored:

* Speed (requests/second)

* SLOC (source lines of code)

* Scalability (performance under load v. not)

* Memory use (per request, both under load v. not)
